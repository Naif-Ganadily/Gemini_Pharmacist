<h2>üö© Disclaimer</h2>

**AI Pharmacist is a supplemental tool:** This application is intended to support, not replace, the relationship that exists between a patient/site visitor and his/her existing physician. It provides pharmaceutical information based on image analysis but should not be solely relied upon for making health-related decisions.

**Consultation with a Medical Professional is Advised:** Before making any changes to your medication or if you have questions regarding your medical condition, it is vital to consult with a healthcare provider or a licensed pharmacist.

**No Liability for Health Decisions:** The developers of AI Pharmacist disclaim any responsibility for adverse health outcomes or medication errors resulting from the use of this software. Users are encouraged to exercise caution and always discuss their medication with a qualified healthcare provider.

**Accuracy and Limitations:** While effort is made to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the information provided by AI Pharmacist, the application may not cover all possible drug interactions or clinical scenarios. The information is provided "as is" without warranty of any kind.

By incorporating this adjusted content, your AI Pharmacist project webpage will clearly communicate its purpose, features, and the critical importance of professional medical advice, alongside a robust disclaimer to guide users appropriately and mitigate legal risks.

**Not a Substitute for Professional Nutritional Advice:** Nutritionist Advisor is not a replacement for professional dietary consultation. Users are strongly advised to seek and adhere to the advice of certified dietitians or nutritionists, especially for special dietary needs or health conditions.

**Health and Well-being First:** Users should always prioritize their health and adhere to dietary recommendations based on their individual health profiles. Nutritionist Advisor aims to provide helpful information, but it should align with a prudent understanding of personal nutritional needs.
